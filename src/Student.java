// CLASS: Student
//
// DESCRIPTION
// Student is an abstract class and is the superclass for the OnCampusStudent and OnlineStudent
// classes. Remember that in a class hierarchy, the superclass declares data and methods that are
// common to all types of students.

     * abstract calcTuition()
     *
     * calcTuition() is to be implemented by subclasses of Student. Remember that abstract methods
     * are not implemented in a superclass but must either be implemented in a subclass, or if not,
     * then the subclass also becomes an abstract class. The reason calcTuition() is abstract
     * and intended to be implemented by the subclasses of Student is because how we calculate the
     * tuition for an OnCampusStudent is different than how we calculate the tuition for an Online-
     * Student.

    /**
     * The java.lang.Comparable<T> interface declares one method int compareTo(T obj) that must be
     * implemented by any class which implements the interface. This method is called from Sorter.
     * keepMoving() to compare the mId fields of two Students.
     *
     * Compares the mId fields of 'this' Student and pStudent. Returns -1 if this Student's mId
     * field is less than pStudent's mId field. Returns 0 if this Student's mId field is equal to
     * pStudent's mId field. Returns 1 if this Student's mId field is greater than pStudent's mId
     * field.
     *
     * Note that the mId field of a Student is a java.lang.String and String also implements the
     * Comparable<String> interface and consequently, also implements a compareTo() method to
     * compare two strings. Hence, all we have to do here is to call the String class compareTo()
     * method on the two mId strings of 'this' Student and pStudent and return whatever that method
     * returns.
